# Notion-Sprint-Updater
Setting up Notion scripts through the use of their API

## Notes
I am organizing my projects and tasks in a scrum style Notion workspace. However, I have daily tasks and it's not possible for Notion to assign them to the current sprint. Thus, I created a script using the Notion API and GitHub Actions to automatically set new tasks to the current sprint.

This script uses Github Actions to run a Node.js script at 5:00 AM EST every weekday.
